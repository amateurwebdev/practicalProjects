# practicalProjects
Learning to code is a new skill that is popular these days. It is so much in demand that schools have added programming in their curriculum. 
Programming and coding are often used interchangeably but both are different and you can read about them anywhere.
With every chore being digitised & becoming smart and automotive with the AI technology, learning to code has become the need of an era.

Everything that you can possibly think of can be done using an app or a website. 
From ordering a cab/food or shopping online to watching movies or even taking a course & gaming skills. 
With applications being digitised the demand also increases for developers and programmers and hence learning a programming language would be beneficial.

I guess I started my github to document practical projects I have come across to reinforce and build on my learning.
I feel that you shouldn't get stuck in the learning forever and begin 'to do' or do as you go so that you remember things a lot better.

If there are recommendations to projects, would love to be contacted.
I believe my twitter can be found on my profile.
